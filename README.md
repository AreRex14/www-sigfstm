### Getting started
Make sure your computer already installed ruby. You can check it by run `ruby -v` in terminal. This is used to make sure jekyl run properly. Check out [kaitoAckerman](https://github.com/kaitoAckerman) on his [post](https://kaitoackerman.site/gem-and-ruby/) about Gem and Ruby :p.

```
~ âžœ ruby -v

```

Once Ruby is installed, you can start fork this repository by clicking fork button and clone it to your computer.

In your local computer, in project root directory. You can open up terminal and run `gem install bundler` and then `bundle install`. That's it. Now you can start contributing. Of course you need some information about how the folder structure works, you can check it [here](500).
